<h1>General Area Of Investigation</h1>
We plan to investigate NFL game data to determine if certain statistics, such as passing yards or rushing yards, are more relevant than others for determining the winning team.

<h1>Current Research</h1>
While research on this topic for soccer and basketball are reasonably prevalant, Lepschy (2018) and Otten (2015), studies on results in football are not nearly as popular.
One notable exception is Arkes (2011), but it is a decade old which means current trends may be different and 
he was not able to leverage the amount of data we have available in today's world. 

<h1>Our Question</h1>
From Arkes (2011) we came up with 2 main questions</br>
1) What statistics are most important in determining the winning team in an NFL game?</br>
2) What level of data is most relevant for NFL games?

Arkes posed that you cannot view a football game as a single unit but should instead view it in terms of halves. His paper clearly demonstrated that the first half stats meaningfully
impacted the second half stats. We plan to explore if his view was granular enough. Football is not a game of halves, but of plays and drives. We plan to investigate if 
viewing the game at the play-by-play level (a feat now acheivable that was not feasable in 2011) yields different results. We will use data from the NFL obtained via nflscrapR
