Repository for Fall 6162 Project

<b>Motivation and Goals</b>
The motivating question behind this project is to "Which Stats Are the Best Indicators of Team Performance in the NFL?". 
The primary data used to determine this can be found here [here](https://www.kaggle.com/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016)
The bulk of the analysis will be in a jupyter notebook using python and pandas that will be accessible.
